#the idea here is to relearn python from the basics
#this will just be lists and stuff and basic things in python to start
#want this to be everything up to for loops I'd believe
#This is part 1
print(type(17)) #type just means the type of text we have (integer, string, float)
print(type(3.2))
print(42,000) #here we see python has treated this is a PAIR of values, not one separate thing
print(42000) #print can print any number of values, granted they are separated via comma
print(3.4, 'hello', 1000) #these are three separate values here
#overview -> type shows type (three of them) and we print with print
#knowing we have types of things, sometimes we want to convert them and we can do that via
#str, int, float which are all functions see below
print(3.14, str(3.14), int(3.14), int(3.9999))
#the important thing to note here is that int rounds down not up 
print("2345", int("2345")) #here we take a string "" and turn it into number
print(float(3.14))
#end of type of things (start variables)
