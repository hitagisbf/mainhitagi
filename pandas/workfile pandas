#This will be work file pandas that I made at work using BQNT, basically all notes that I make without my macbook 

#I was thinking about some excel to dataframe uscases such as df.to_csv

#Section on insepcting an Array -> given that we have some variables set for thesee arrays, the important thing
#here will be that the len, ndim, shape basically all things following the dot value will be what we are trying to do 
#whether that be find the length, array dimensions, elements or something else 

#We call this section Inspecting the array, fo this we will also just make examples to this 

d.shape
len(d)  #length of an array 
b.ndim #number of array dimensions 
e.size #number of array elements 
b.dtype #type of data type 
b.dtype.name #name of data type
b.astype(int) #how we can change the array to a different type 



#Different Data types -> For these since there are no variables set to them just like that we will come up with examples for these


np.int64 #signed 64 bit integer type 
np.float32 #standard double precision float 
np.complex #complex numbers represented by 128 floats where a complex number we know as an imaginary number added to a constant 
np.bool #true or false values string (storing those values)
np.object #pythons object type
np.string #Fixed length string type 
np.unicode #Fixed length Unicode type 

#Sorting an Array

a.sort() #we Sort an array this way 
c.sort(axis=0) #sort the elements of an array's axis 

#Subsetting, Slicing, and Indexing an Array 

a[2] #just selects the element at the second index (index values start at 0, so an index of 2 is 0,1,2, where the 2nd index is 2)
b[1,2] #Element at row 1 and column 2 

#call those two examples subsetting 

#SLicing 

a[1:2] #selects item at 1 and 2 
b[]
